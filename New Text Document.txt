Linux
Go into your bot folder with : cd BotFolderLocation
Use nano start.sh to create a file called start.sh and start editing.
Paste the code below :
# /bin/sh
while true
do
echo Starting Bot
node bot.js
echo Restarting Bot in 5 Seconds...
sleep 5
done
Press CTRL+C then Y and ENTER to save the start.sh file.
Use chmod 777 start.sh to give the file executable permission.
Done! Now you can start your bot by executing that file with : ./start.sh
